## Background information  
Three dummy-districts want to catch the excess of energy that are produced by solar panels on the houses within that district. The batteries that catch this excessive energy have a limited amount they can contain. Therefore, the houses in each district have to be divided among the batteries so as much energy as possible can be saved for the smallest cost possible. The houses are connected to the batteries through cables. The length of the cables should therefore be minimized to minimize cost.  

## What do we need?
### Used Packages  
All coding has been written in Python 3.7. We made use of the following packages:  
-	Pip  
-	Matplotlib  
-	Random  
- 	Copy  

### Use  
To run the written program type in:  
‘python main.py [algorithm] [district number] [basis/advanced5]’  

### Outline  
To sum up the outline of the most important folders and files, see the following list:  
*   /code: here you will find all code
	* /code/algorithms: here you will find all code to 
	* /code/classes: here you will find all the classes that will construct the data 
	* /code/visualization: here you will find the code that will visualize the outcome in a grid
*   /data: here you will find all datafiles that serve as input sources to solve the above mentioned problem with the use of the created algorithms
